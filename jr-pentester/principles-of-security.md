# Principles of Privilege
Level of access granted to individuals determined by 2 factors:
* individuals role/function 
* the sensitivity of the information on the system

## 2 Methods of Managing Access Rights
### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
PIM used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system.
### Privileged Access Management (PAM)

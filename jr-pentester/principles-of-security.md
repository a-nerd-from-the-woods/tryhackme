# Intro
Defense in Depth = layer security for an organization.

# CIA Triad
**Confidentiality** = Only those intended can see the data

**Integrity** = Only those intended can modify the data

**Availability** = Everyone intended has access to the data

# Principles of Privilege
Level of access granted to individuals determined by 2 factors:
* individuals role/function 
* the sensitivity of the information on the system

## 2 Methods of Managing Access Rights
### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
PIM used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system.
### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
PAM is the management of the privileges a system's access role has.
### Least Privilege
The concept of giving user and systems the least amount of privilege needed in order for it to preform its function. 
# Security Models Continued
## Bell-La Padula Model 

This Model is used to ensure confidentiality. It assumptions that everyone in the organization has well defined responsibilities. It works by granting access to objects on a need to know basis. Its popular in government and military organization because its members are assumed have already gone through a vetting process. 

Pros:
1. Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organizations hierarchies
2. Simple to implement and understand

Cons:
1. Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence
2. The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organization

## Biba Model 

This model allows users (subjects) can create objects (data) at or below their level by only read objects above their level.

Pros:
1. Simple to implement.
2. Resolves the limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity.

Cons:
1. With so many levels, it is easy for something to get overlooked.
2. Creates delays, for example a doctor would not be able to read a nurses notes.

# Threat Modeling & Incident Response
System storing information = information system

* Threat modeling = the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols.
  * A critical stage is identifying likely threats that an application or system.
  * TM is similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces.
* Principles of TM Boiled Now
  * Preparation
  * Identification
  * Mitigations
  * Review
* An effective model includes:
  * Threat intelligence
  * Asset identification
  * Mitigation capabilities
  * Risk assessment

## Recommended TM Frameworks 
### STRIDE

1. Spoofing = The principle of authenticating requests. Spoofing is a user falsely identifying as another.
3. Tampering = Protecting the integrity via protecting a system of application.
4. Repudiation = The logging of system or application activity.
5. Information Disclosure = Apps or services that handle information need to be properly configure with user access controls.
6. Denial of Service = Having measures in place to prevent the apps/service/system from going completely down.
7. Elevation of Privilege = Preventing a user from graining greater privilage or accessing something outside of their privliage.

### CSIRT

1. Preparation = Do we have the means and plans to deal with a security incident
2. Identification = Theats and threat actor identified. 
3. Containment = Containing the threat if possible.
4. Eradication = Removing the threat.
5. Recovery = Doing a full review of affected systems.
6. Lessons Learned = How can we prevent this from re-occuring.

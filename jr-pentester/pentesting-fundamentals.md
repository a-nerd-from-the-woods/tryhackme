# Penetration Testing Ethics

## Hacker Hats
### White Hat 
These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.

For example, a penetration tester performing an authorized engagement on a company.

### Grey Hat

These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.

For example, someone taking down a scamming site.

### Black Hat

These peopleÂ  are criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
* created at initial stages of penetration
* consists of 3 sections:
	* permissions
		* gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. 
	* test scope
		* annotate specific targets 
	* rules
		* define exactly the techniques that are permitted 
# Penetration Testing Methodologies
## General Outline 
1. Information Gathering
	* collect as much public info as possible about target / organization
	* DOES NOT INVOLVE SCANNING SYSTEMS
2. Scanning
	* discovering applications and services running on a/the system(s)
3. Exploitation
	* leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application
4. Privilege Escalation
	* the attempt to expand your access to a system
5. Post-exploitation
	1. what other systems can be targeted (pivoting)
	2. what additional information can be harvested from the system we are currently inside
	3. covering your tracks
	4. reporting

## OSSTMM
[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is designed for **Telecommunications**(phones, VoIP, etc), **Wired Networks**, **Wireless communications**.

Pros:
* Covers various testing strategies in-depth.
* Includes testing strategies for specific targets
* flexible depending upon the organisation's needs

Cons:
* meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario

## OWASP
Pros:
* Easy to pick up and understand
* frequently updated
* covers all stages of an engagement
* Specializes in web applications and services


Cons:
* It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap).
* OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles.
* doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK

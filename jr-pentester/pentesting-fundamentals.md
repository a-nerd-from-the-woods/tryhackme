# Penetration Testing Ethics

## Hacker Hats
### White Hat 
These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.

For example, a penetration tester performing an authorized engagement on a company.

### Grey Hat

These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.

For example, someone taking down a scamming site.

### Black Hat

These peopleÂ  are criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
* created at initial stages of penetration
* consists of 3 sections:
	* permissions
		* gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. 
	* test scope
		* annotate specific targets 
	* rules
		* define exactly the techniques that are permitted 
# Penetration Testing Methodologies
## General Outline 
1. Information Gathering
	* collect as much public info as possible about target / organization
	* DOES NOT INVOLVE SCANNING SYSTEMS
2. Scanning
	* discovering applications and services running on a/the system(s)
3. Exploitation
	* leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application
4. Privilege Escalation
	* the attempt to expand your access to a system
5. Post-exploitation
	1. what other systems can be targeted (pivoting)
	2. what additional information can be harvested from the system we are currently inside
	3. covering your tracks
	4. reporting

## OSSTMM
[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is designed for **Telecommunications**(phones, VoIP, etc), **Wired Networks**, **Wireless communications**.

Pros:
* Covers various testing strategies in-depth.
* Includes testing strategies for specific targets
* flexible depending upon the organisation's needs

Cons:
* meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario

## OWASP
The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

Pros:
* Easy to pick up and understand
* frequently updated
* covers all stages of an engagement
* Specializes in web applications and services


Cons:
* It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap).
* OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles.
* doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK

## NIST Cyber Security Framework 1.1
  

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organizations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honorable mention because of its popularity and detail.

Pros:
* Used by 50% of US organizations by 2020
* extremely detailed
* frequently updated
* certs available
* designed to work with other frameworks

Cons:
* Hard to find version for you
* weak auditing policies
* no cloud computing

## NCSC CAF
The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

Focuses on:
* Data security
* System security
* Identity and access control
* Resiliency
* Monitoring
* Response and recovery planning

Pros:
* backed by government cyber security agencies
* certs available 
* covers 14 concepts ranging from security to response

Cons:
* new
* base on concepts, more indirect than other frameworks

# Box Knowledge Levels

## Black-Box Testing

Tester is **not given any information** about the box or application. 

## Grey-Box Testing

The most popular way of testing. The tester will have some **limit knowledge**, but other wise the box will be treated like a black box. 

## White-Box Testing

Tester will have full knowledge of the box.
